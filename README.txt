The code is compiled in Visual Studio Code. Uses sklearn libraries for classifiers. Has split data into training and test sets. Has Naive Bayes and K-NN Classifiers implemented with some results and plots. Have to implement RandomForest Classifier and SVM. When it is complete, the software will compare the accuracy of 4 different classifiers through a error calculation formula.

Tasks left:
1. Implementing RandomForest and SVM Classifiers
2. Comparing all
3. Results and Analysis
